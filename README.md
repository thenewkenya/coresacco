## Database Schema

### Core Models

- Members belong to branches
- Accounts belong to members
- Loans are associated with members and loan types
- Transactions are linked to accounts

## Authentication & Authorization

The system uses Laravel Sanctum for API authentication:

```bash
# Get authentication token
POST /api/auth/login
{
    "email": "user@example.com",

}
```
